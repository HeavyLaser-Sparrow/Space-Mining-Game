This is an idle space mining game. If you cannot see anything happening, it is because 
the idle part of the game is taking part in another thread (the backend). Trust that it 
works (click enter to see the change). If there is a problem or an improvement, please tell 
me in the pull requests or issues. Most of this was made by ChatGPT, but I made a LOT of changes for readability on the player side, better gameplay, etc.
